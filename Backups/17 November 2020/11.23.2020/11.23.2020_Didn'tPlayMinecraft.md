November 23rd 2020 - Didn't play

I haven't been playing Minecraft lately, as I am having a stressful time working on uploading all the backups to GitHub. I originally quit for a break, but after 2 days, this was the main new reason.
I will try to play Minecraft again when it gets later into the year, or when I make enough process (probably 0.2% to 2.0%) on uploading Minecraft backups.
